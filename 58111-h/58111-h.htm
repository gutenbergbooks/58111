<div class="chapter"><h2>PREFACE.</h2></div>

<p>The object of this book is to give a plain account of the best known
habits of spiders, and as much of their anatomy and classification as
is necessary to understand these habits. The portion on the spinning
and flying habits is copied chiefly from Blackwall and Menge; that
on the trap-door spiders from Moggridge; and the habits of Nephila
and Hyptiotes, from Wilder. The observations of these authors have
been repeated as far as possible, and some changes and additions made
to their accounts of them. The numerous stories of deadly poison,
supernatural wisdom, and enormous size and strength of spiders, have
been omitted as doubtful. Several cuts from the papers of Professor
Wilder have been repeated by favor of the author and publishers. Most
of the figures are, however, new, and engraved by photography from my
own drawings.</p>

<p class="f150"><b>THE STRUCTURE AND HABITS<br />OF SPIDERS</b>.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">ANATOMY AND CLASSIFICATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The spiders form a small and distinct group of animals, related
to the scorpions, the daddy-long-legs, and the mites, and less
closely to the insects and crabs. They are distinguished by the more
complete separation of the body into two parts; by their two-jointed
mandibles, discharging a poisonous secretion at the tip; and by their
spinning-organs, and habits of making cobwebs and silk cocoons for
their eggs.</p>

<p>The common round-web spider, <i>Epeira vulgaris</i> of Hentz, will serve as
well as any species to show the anatomy of spiders in general. <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
shows the under side of this spider; <a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>, the upper side;
and <a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a>, an imaginary section through the body, to show
the arrangement of the internal organs. To begin with <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>:
the body is seen to be divided into two parts, connected only by the
narrow joint, A, just behind the last pair of legs. The front half
of the body, called the thorax, contains the stomach, the central
part of the nervous system, and the large muscles which work the legs
and jaws. The hinder half, the abdomen, contains the intestine, the
breathing-organs, the principal circulating-vessels, the organs of
reproduction, and the spinning-organs. Connected with the thorax are
six pairs of limbs, four pairs of legs, B B B B, a pair of palpi, C,
and a pair of mandibles, D.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<h3>LEGS.</h3>

<p>The legs are used chiefly for running, jumping, and climbing; but the
front pair serve often as feelers, being held up before the body while
the spider walks steadily enough on the other six. One or both of the
hinder legs are used to guide the thread in spinning; the spider at
the same time walking or climbing about with the other six or seven.
The legs are seven-jointed; and on the terminal joint are three claws,
<a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>, A, B, C, and various hair and spines. In
many spiders a brush of hairs takes the place of the middle claw, as in
the jumping spiders, <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>. Spiders with these
brushes on their feet can walk up a steep surface, or under a
horizontal one, better than those who have three claws. The legs of
most spiders have among the hairs movable spines, which, when the
spider is running about, extend outward at a right angle with the leg,
and, when it is resting, are closed down against the skin.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h3>PALPI.</h3>

<p>In front of the legs are the palpi, <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>,
C, C,—a smaller pair of limbs, with six joints and only one claw or
none. They are used as feelers, and for handling food, and, in the
males, carry the curious palpal organs, which will be described farther
on. The basal joints, <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>, E, of the palpi are
flattened out, and serve as chewing-organs, called “maxillæ.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_3" id="FIG_3"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_03.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="631" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 3.</b></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Mr. Mason has lately described, in the Transactions of the
Entomological Society of London, a large spider which has teeth on
the inside of the palpi, which, when the spider is angry, are rubbed
against teeth on the mandibles, producing a noise.</p>

<h3>MANDIBLES.</h3>

<p>The front pair of limbs, the mandibles, <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>, D,
are two-jointed. The basal joint is usually short and stout, and
furnished on the inner side with teeth and hairs. The terminal joint
is a small and sharp claw, which can be closed against the basal joint
when not in use.</p>

<h3>ABDOMEN.</h3>

<p>On the under side of the abdomen, just behind the last pair of
legs, are two hard, smooth patches, which cover the front pair of
breathing-organs, the openings to which are two little slits at <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>,
H. Between these is the opening of the reproductive organs, and, in
female spiders, the epigynum, <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>, J,—an apparatus
for holding the reproductive cells of the male.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the body are the spinnerets, which will be described in
another chapter. There are three pairs of them; but many spiders close
them together when not in use, so as to cover up the middle pair. The
third pair of spinnerets are often several-jointed, and extend out
behind the body like two tails. In front of the spinnerets is a little
opening, <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>, K, which leads to air-tubes that
give off branches to different parts of the abdomen. At M, <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>,
are usually two colored bands, or rows of spots, marking the course of
muscles attached to the skin at various points along these lines.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a> is the back of the same spider. The head
is not separated from the rest of the body, as in insects, but forms,
with the thorax, one piece. On the front of the head are eight eyes,
Q, which are differently arranged in different spiders. At the back
part of the thorax is a groove, P, under which is attached a muscle
for moving the sucking-stomach, <a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a>, <i>d</i>.
From this point radiate shallow grooves, that follow the divisions
between the muscles of the legs. On the abdomen are several pairs of
dark smooth spots, which mark the ends of muscles extending downward
through the abdomen. The markings of this spider are very complicated.
The spot on the middle of the front of the abdomen is a very common
one, and, in some spiders, extends the whole length of the body. The
waved lines on each side are also common, and, in long-bodied spiders,
often form two bright-colored stripes, or rows of spots, running nearly
straight the whole length of the abdomen.

<h3>INTESTINE.</h3>

<p><a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a> is a section of the same spider. The
mouth is at <i>a b</i>, just under and behind the mandibles, and between
the maxillæ. It has an upper, <i>a</i>, and under lip, <i>b</i>, each lined with
a horny plate, in the middle of which runs a groove. When the lips are
closed, the two grooves form a tube, which leads to the œsophagus,
<i>c</i>, and so into the stomach. At the end of the œsophagus is the
sucking-stomach. This consists of a flattened tube, to the top of which
is attached a muscle, <i>d</i>, connected with the groove in the back; and
to the bottom, muscles, <i>f</i>, attached to a tough diaphragm spreading
across the thorax, and fastened between the legs on each side at <i>g g</i>.
When these muscles contract, the top and bottom of the sucking-stomach
are drawn apart, and whatever is in the œsophagus sucked in. By
this pumping motion the spider is supposed to take liquid food from
the mouth, and drive it backward into the abdomen. Just behind the
sucking-stomach, the intestine gives off two branches, <i>e e</i>, which
extend forward around the stomach muscle, and meet over the mouth. Each
of these branches gives off on the outer side four smaller branches, <i>m
m m m</i>, which extend downward,—one in front of each leg,—and unite on
the under side of the thorax.

</ul>

<p>The intestine, <i>o</i>, continues backward through the abdomen to the
anus, in the little knob behind the spinnerete. The brown mass which
surrounds the intestine, and fills the abdomen above it, is supposed to
be a secreting-organ discharging into the intestine at several points.</p>

<h3>HEART.</h3>

<p>Over the intestine, and parallel with it, is the heart, <i>p</i>, a muscular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
tube, with openings along the sides to receive the blood, and branches
through which it flows to different parts of the body. The greater part
of the blood enters at the front of the heart, and passes backward into
the abdomen, or forward into the thorax.</p>

<h3>BREATHING-ORGANS.</h3>

<p>In the front of the abdomen are the principal breathing-organs,—a
pair of sacs, R, containing a number of thin plates, through which the
blood passes on its way to the heart. Besides these, there is a pair of
branching air-tubes, <i>t</i>, opening near the spinnerets.</p>

<h3>NERVOUS SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>The nervous system has a large ganglion, J, in the thorax, from which
branches, <i>i</i>, pass to the limbs and abdomen. At the front end two
branches extend upward, each side of the œsophagus, to two smaller
ganglia, <i>k</i>, from which pass nerves to the mandibles and eyes.</p>

<p>The reproductive organs, S, lie along the under side of the abdomen,
and open between the two air-sacs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>The spinning-glands, <i>u</i>, lie above the spinnerets, and along the under
side of the abdomen. They will be more fully described in the chapter
on spinning.</p>

<h3>POISON-GLANDS.</h3>

<p>The poison-glands, <i>n</i>, are partly in the basal joints of the
mandibles, and partly in the head, and discharge by a tube which opens
at the point of the claw of the mandible, <a href="#FIG_14-15">Fig. 15</a>,
<i>a</i>.</p>

<h3>CLASSIFICATION.</h3>

<p>There is not room in this book to explain the classification of spiders
into genera and species; but a description of the following well-marked
groups, which contain nine-tenths of all spiders, will give a general
idea of the differences among them, and help to understand what follows.</p>

</div>

<h3>MYGALIDÆ</h3>

<p>This family includes the largest known spiders. The body is usually
very hairy and dark-colored. Most species have only four spinnerets;
and one pair of these are long, and are turned up behind the abdomen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
They have four air-sacs under the front of the abdomen, instead of two,
as other spiders. Their mandibles are very large, and work up and down,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
instead of sidewise. The eyes are collected together on the front
of the head. They live only in warm countries. Specimens from South
America are exhibited in every natural history museum. <a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a>
represents <i>Mygale Hentzii</i>, a species living in Arizona and Texas.</p>

<h3>DYSDERIDÆ.</h3>

<p>A small family of spiders with only six eyes. They have also four
breathing-holes in the front of the abdomen; but one pair leads to
branched tubes instead of sacs. They are usually found under stones,
with their legs drawn up close to their bodies, but can move very
quickly when so inclined. Very few species are known, and none are
common, in North America. <a href="#FIG_7-8">Fig. 7</a> is <i>Dysdera interrita</i>
enlarged. Below are the eyes as seen from in front.</p>

<h3>DRASSIDÆ.</h3>

<p>A large family of spiders, varying greatly in shape, color, and habits.
Most of them are dull colored, and live under stones, or in silk tubes
on plants, and make no webs for catching insects. Their eyes are small,
and arranged in two rows on the front of the head. Their feet have two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
claws and a bunch of flat hairs. The spinnerets are usually long enough
to extend a little behind the abdomen. <a href="#FIG_7-8">Fig. 8</a> is a
<i>Drassus</i>, and the eyes as seen from in front.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<h3>AGALENIDÆ.</h3>

<p>Long-legged, brown spiders, with two spinnerets longer than the
others, and extending out behind the body. They make flat webs, with
a funnel-shaped tube at one side, <a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24</a>, in which
the spider waits. <a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a> is <i>Agalena nævia</i>, the
common grass spider.

<h3>CINIFLONIDÆ.</h3>

<p>A family resembling the last, but having peculiar spinning-organs,
which will be described farther on, <a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35</a>.</p>

<h3>LYCOSIDÆ.</h3>

<p>The running spiders. Very active spiders, living in open places, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
catching their prey without webs. Their legs are long, the hind pair
being the longest. The head is high, and the arrangement of the eyes
peculiar to the family, <a href="#FIG_10">Fig. 10</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 10.</b></p>
</div>

<h3>ATTIDÆ.</h3>

<p>The jumping spiders. The body is usually short, and the head square.
The arrangement of the eyes is characteristic, <a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<i>a</i>. The two large ones in the middle give these spiders a more
animated look than those of other families. The legs are short, and
the front pair often stouter than the others. They can walk easily
backwards or sidewise, and jump a long distance. <a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11</a>
is the common gray jumping spider enlarged.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<h3>THOMISIDÆ.</h3>

<p class="space-below2">The crab spiders. The body is usually flat, and
wide behind. The front two pair of legs are longer than the others, and
so bent that the spider can use them when in a narrow crack. Some of
them, like crabs, walk better sidewise than forwards. Like the running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and jumping spiders, they make no webs for catching food. The eyes are
small, and simply arranged in two rows, <a href="#FIG_12">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 12.</b></p>
</div>

<h3>THERIDIIDÆ.</h3>

<p class="space-below2">The largest family of spiders. Most of them are
small, with large rounded abdomens and slender legs. They live usually
upside down, holding by their feet under their webs. They make large
cobwebs of different shapes for different species, and depend for food
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
on what is caught in them. To this group belongs the genus <i>Erigone</i>,

<div class="chapter"><h2>CHAPTER II.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">EATING AND BITING.</span></h2></div>

<p>The spiders are best known and hated as animals that bite. The
biting apparatus is shown in <a href="#FIG_14-15">Fig. 14</a>,
which represents the head and mandibles of <i>Epeira vulgaris</i>, seen
from in front. When not in use, the claw is closed up against the
mandible between the rows of teeth; but, when the jaws are opened to
bite, the claws are turned outward, so that their points can be stuck
into any thing between the jaws. <a href="#FIG_14-15">Fig. 15</a> is the claw
still more enlarged, showing a little hole near the point at <i>a</i>,
out of which is discharged the secretion of a gland in the head, <a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a>, <i>n</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
The ordinary use of the mandibles is for killing and crushing insects,
so that the soft parts can be eaten by the spider; and in this they
are aided by the maxillæ, <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>, E. They will
sometimes chew an insect for hours, until it becomes a round lump of
skin, with all the blood sucked out of it; this is then thrown away,
the spider swallowing only such bits as may happen to be sucked in with
the liquid portion.</p>

<p>If let alone, no spiders bite any thing except insects useful for food;
but, when attacked and cornered, all species open their jaws, and
bite if they can; their ability to do so depending on their size, and
the strength of their jaws. Notwithstanding the number of stings and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
pimples that are laid to spiders, undoubted cases of their biting the
human skin are very rare; and the stories of death, insanity, and
lameness from spider-bites, are probably all untrue.</p>

<p>Many experiments have been tried to test the effect of the bites
of spiders on animals. Doleschall shut up small birds with <i>Mygale
Javanica</i> and <i>Mygale Sumatrensis</i>, both large and strong spiders; and
the birds died in a few seconds after being bitten. One of the spiders
was left for ten days without food, and then made to bite another bird,
which was injured, but in six hours recovered. The same author was
bitten in the finger by a jumping spider. The pain was severe for a few
minutes, and was followed by lameness of the finger, and gradually of
the hand and arm, which soon went away entirely.</p>

<p>Bertkau allowed spiders to bite his hand. On the ends of the fingers
the skin was too thick; but between the fingers they easily pricked
it. The bite swelled and smarted for a quarter of an hour, and then
itched for some time, and for a day after itched whenever rubbed, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
mosquito-bites will. He also experimented on flies, which died in a few
minutes after being bitten.</p>

<p>Mr. Blackwall, to test the poison of spiders, made several large ones
bite his hand and arm, and at the same time pricked himself with a
needle. Although the spiders bit deep enough to draw blood, the effect
of their bite was exactly like that of the prick of the needle. No
inflammation or pain followed, and both healed immediately.</p>

<p>Several spiders were placed together, and made to bite one another. The
bitten ones lived always some hours, and died from loss of blood; and
one spider, that had been bitten in the abdomen so that some of the
liver escaped and dried on the outside, lived over a year, apparently
in good health.</p>

<p>A large spider was made to bite a wasp near the base of the right
front-wing, so as to disable it; but it lived thirteen hours.</p>

<p>A bee was bitten by a large spider, but lived three days.</p>

<p>A grasshopper was bitten, and held in the jaws of a spider for several
seconds; but it lived in apparent health for two days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Insects of the same kinds were wounded in the same places with needles,
and died in about the same time as when bitten.</p>

<p>From these experiments Mr. Blackwall was led to believe that the
secretion from the spider’s jaws is not poisonous, but that insects
die, when bitten, from loss of blood and mechanical injury.</p>

<p>Mr. Moggridge, who studied the habits of trap-door spiders for several
years, was more than once bitten by them, but never had any pain or
inflammation from the bites.</p>

<p>The bites of <i>Latrodectus guttatus</i> of the south of Europe, and an
allied species in California, are much dreaded, but probably as much on
account of the size and conspicuous colors of the spider as any thing else.</p>

<p>The Tarantula, also a south European spider, has been supposed to
cause epilepsy by its bites, which could only be relieved by music of
particular kinds. These stories appear, however, to be all nonsense: at
any rate, the Tarantula bites produce no such effect nowadays. These
spiders live in holes in sand, out of which they rush after passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
insects, and may be caught by a straw moved carefully over the holes
like an insect. They are no more savage in their habits than other
spiders; and Dufour kept one that soon learned to take flies from his
fingers without biting him.</p>

<p>Spiders of very different species soon learn to take food from the hand
or a pair of forceps, or water from a brush, and will come to the mouth
of their bottle, and reach after it on tiptoe.</p>

<p>Many stories are told of spiders coming out of their holes to listen to
music, and of their being taught to come out and take food at the sound
of an instrument.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>CHAPTER III.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">SPINNING HABITS.</span></h2></div>

<p class="space-below2">That which, more than any thing else,
distinguishes spiders from other animals is the habit of spinning
webs. Some of the mites spin irregular threads on plants, or cocoons
for their eggs; and many insects spin cocoons in which to pass through
the change from larva to adult. In the spiders the spinning-organs are
much more complicated, and used for a greater variety of purposes,—for
making egg-cocoons, silk linings to their nests, and nets for catching
insects. The spider’s thread differs from that of insects, in being
made up of a great number of finer threads laid together while soft
enough to unite into one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPINNERETS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_16" id="FIG_16"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_16.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 16.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The external spinning-organs are little two-jointed tubes on the ends
of the spinnerets, <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>, L. <a href="#FIG_16">Fig. 16</a>
is the spinnerets of the same spider, still more enlarged to show the
arrangement of the tubes. There is a large number of little tubes on
each spinneret, and in certain places a few larger ones. <a href="#FIG_17-18">Fig. 17</a>
is a single tube, showing the ducta which leads the viscid liquid to form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the thread from a gland in the spider’s abdomen. Each tube is the
outlet of a separate gland. <a href="#FIG_17-18">Fig. 18</a>, <i>a</i>, shows
four small tubes from a spinneret of <i>Epeira</i>, each with a small gland
attached; and <a href="#FIG_17-18">Fig. 18</a>, <i>b</i>, a large tube, with
one of the large glands which extends forward the whole length of the
abdomen, <a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a>, <i>u</i>.</p>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">
   <a id="FIG_17-18" name="FIG_17-18">
   <img src="images/fig_17.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="240" /></a>

   <p class="center space-above3"><big><b>Fig. 18</b>.</big></p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>The shape of the spinnerets, and size and arrangement of the tubes,
vary in different species. <a href="#FIG_19">Fig. 19</a> is a spinneret of
<i>Prosthesima</i>, where there are a few large tubes in place of many
small ones. In <i>Agalena</i> the two hinder spinnerets are long, and have
spinning-tubes along the under side of the last joint, <a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p class="space-below2">When the spider begins a thread, it presses the
spinnerets against some object, and forces out enough of the secretion
from each tube to adhere to it. Then it moves the spinnerets away; and
the viscid liquid is drawn out, and hardens at once into threads,—one
from each tube. If the spinnerets are kept apart, a band of threads is
formed; but, if they are closed together, the fine threads unite into
one or more larger ones. If a spider is allowed to attach its thread to
glass, the end can be seen spread out over a surface as large as the
ends of the spinnerets, covered with very fine threads pointing toward
the middle, where they unite, <a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a>.</p>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">
   <a id="FIG_19" name="FIG_19"><img src="images/fig_19.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="233" /></a>

</div>

<p>The spinning is commonly helped by the hinder feet, which guide the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
thread, and keep it clear of surrounding objects, and even pull it from
the spinnerets. This is well seen when an insect has been caught in a
web, and the spider is trying to tie it up with threads. She goes as
near as she safely can, and draws out a band of fine threads, which she
reaches out toward the insect with one of her hind-feet; so that it may
strike the threads as it kicks, and become entangled with them. As soon
as the insect is tied tightly enough to be handled, the spider holds
and turns it over and over with her third pair of feet, while, with the
fourth pair, she draws out, hand over hand, the band of fine threads
which adhere to the insect as it turns, and soon cover it entirely.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_21" id="FIG_21"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_21.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="544" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 21.</b></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
It is a common habit with spiders to draw out a thread behind as they
walk along; and in this way they make the great quantities of threads
that sometimes cover a field of grass, or the side of a house. We often
see the points of all the pickets of a fence connected by threads spun
in this way by spiders running down one picket, and up the next, for no
apparent purpose.</p>

<p>Spiders often descend by letting out the thread to which they hang; and
are able to control their speed, and to stop the flow of thread, at
will. They sometimes hang down by a thread, and allow themselves to be
swung by the wind to a considerable distance, letting out the thread
when they feel they are going in the right direction.</p>

<p>Spiders in confinement begin at once to spin, and never seem
comfortable till they can go all over their box without stepping off
their web. The running spiders, that make no other webs, when about to
lay their eggs, find or dig out holes in sheltered places, and line
them with silk. Species that live under stones or on plants all line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
their customary hiding-places with web, to which they hold when at
rest. Several of the large running spiders dig holes in sand, and line
them with web, so that the sand cannot fall in; and build around the
mouth a ring of sticks and straws held together by threads.</p>

<h3>TRAP-DOOR NESTS.</h3>

<p>The building of tubular nests is carried to the greatest perfection by
certain genera of the <i>Mygalidæ</i>. (<a href="#Page_13">See page 13</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Atypus</i>, the most northern genus of this family, makes a strong silken
tube, part of which forms the lining of a hole in the ground, and part
lies above the surface, among stones and plants, <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>,
A. The mouth of the tube is almost always closed, at least when the spider
is full grown.</p>

<p>Another genus, which lives in warm countries, makes tubes lined with
silk, and closed at the top by a trap-door. A common species, <i>Cteniza
Californica</i>, lives in the southern part of California, and is often
brought east by travellers. It digs its hole in a fine soil, that
becomes, when dry, nearly as hard as a brick; but the spider probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
works when the ground is wet. The holes are sometimes nearly an inch
in diameter, and vary in depth from two or three inches to a foot.
The mouth is a little enlarged, and closed by a thick cover that fits
tightly into it, like a cork into a bottle. The cover is made of dirt
fastened together with threads, and is lined, like the tube, with silk,
and fastened by a thick hinge of silk at one side, <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>,
B. When the cover is closed, it looks exactly like the ground around
it. The spider holds on the inside of the door with the mandibles and
the two front pairs of feet; while the third and fourth pairs of legs
are pressed out against the walls of the tube, and hold the spider down
so firmly, that it is impossible to raise the cover without tearing it.</p>

<p>Among the trap-door spiders of Southern Europe, about which Mr. J. T.
Moggridge has written a very interesting book, are species which make
different kinds of nests. The cover, instead of being thick, and wedged
into the top of the tube like a stopper, is thin, and rests on the top
of the hole, <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>, C, and is covered with leaves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
moss, or whatever happens to be lying about; so that it is not
easily seen. Two or three inches down the tube is another door,
<a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>, E, hanging to one side of the tube when
not in use; but, when one tries to dig the spider out from above, she
pushes up the lower door, so that it looks as if it were the bottom of
an empty tube.</p>

<p class="space-below2">Another species digs a branch obliquely upward
from the middle of the tube, closed at the junction by a hanging-door,
which, when pushed upward, can also be used to close the main tube,
<a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>, F. What use the spider makes of such a
complicated nest, nobody knows from observation; but Mr. Moggridge
supposes that when an enemy, a parasitic fly, for instance, comes into
the mouth of the tube, the spider stops up the passage by pressing up
against the lower door; but, if this is not enough, it dodges into the
branch, draws the door to behind it, and leaves the intruder to amuse
himself in the empty tube. The branch is sometimes carried up to the
surface, where it is closed only by a few threads; so that, in case of
siege, the spider could escape, and leave the whole nest to the enemy.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
In these nests the spiders live most of the time, coming out at night,
and some species in the daytime, to catch insects, which they carry
into the tube, and eat. The eggs are laid in the tube; and the young
are hatched, and live there till able to go alone, when they go out,
and dig little holes of their own. As the spider gets larger, the hole
is made wider, and the cover enlarged by adding a layer of earth and
silk; so that an old cover is made up of a number of layers, one over
the other, over the original little cover.</p>

<p>Moggridge once took a <i>Cteniza Californica</i> out of her nest, and
put her on a pot of earth, and the next morning had the good luck to see
her at work digging. She loosened the earth with her mandibles, and
took it in little lumps with the mandibles and maxillæ, and carried it
away piece by piece. It took her an hour to dig a hollow as large as
half a walnut. He saw the making of the door twice by other species.
Once he dug a hole for a spider in some earth, and the next day found
her in it, and the top covered by a little web, on which were scattered
bits of earth and leaves, which had evidently been put there by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
spider. The second night, enough dirt and silk were added to make the
door of the usual thickness; but the spider never finished it so that
it would open properly on its hinge. Another time Moggridge saw at the
mouth of a very small hole a spider at work making a door. She spun
a few threads across the hole, then gathered up with her front-legs
and palpi an armful of dirt, and laid it on top of them. She then got
under the pile, into the tube; but the motions of the dirt showed that
she was still at work on it, and next morning the under side had been
thickly covered with web, and the whole separated from the mouth of
the tube, except at one side, where the usual hinge was left. The new
door was at first soft, but in two or three days hardened, and appeared
exactly like an old door.</p>

<p>These spiders are accustomed to put on the door moss like that which
grows around it, and so conceal the door from sight; but when Mr.
Moggridge took away the moss, and dug up the ground around a hole, and
then destroyed the cover, the spider made a new one, and brought moss
from a distance to put on it, thereby making it the most conspicuous
thing in the neighborhood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. S. S. Saunders tried to see trap-door spiders make their nests.
When the earth was dry, they would do nothing; but, after watering it,
they several times dug new holes, but always in the night.</p>

<p>The food of the European trap-door spiders consists largely of ants and
other wingless insects, and they have been known to eat earthworms and
caterpillars. Mr. Moggridge has often seen them, even in the daytime,
open their doors a little, and snatch at passing insects, sometimes
taking hold of one too large to draw into the tube. One time he and
some friends marked some holes, and went and watched them in the night.
The doors were slightly open, and some of the spiders’ legs thrust out
over the rim of the hole. He held a beetle near one of the spiders; and
she reached the front part of her body out of the tube, pushing the
door wide open, seized the beetle, and backed quickly into the tube
again, the door closing by its own weight. Shortly after, she opened it
again, and put the beetle out alive and unhurt, probably because it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
too hard to eat. He next drove a sow-bug near another hole; and the
spider came out and snatched it in the same way, and kept it. None of
the spiders came entirely out of their holes, and they were only a
little more active than in the daytime.</p>

<p>Erber, in the Island of Tinos, noticed a place where several trap-door
nests were near each other, and spent a moonlight night watching them.
Soon after nine o’clock some of the spiders came out, fastened back
their doors, and each spun a web, about six inches long and an inch
high, among the grass near her hole, and went back into the tube.
In course of time beetles were caught in the webs, and eaten by the
spiders, and the hard parts carried several feet from the nest. The
next morning the webs had been cleared away, and the doors of the tubes
closed, leaving no traces of the night’s work.</p>

<h3>SILK TUBES AND NESTS.</h3>

<p>Several species of <i>Theridion</i> and <i>Epeira</i> make tents near their
webs, under which they hang when at rest, and in which some species
make their cocoons, and lay their eggs. The tents are usually covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
outside with leaves drawn together, with sticks or bud-scales collected
near by, or with earth and stones brought up from the ground below.</p>

<p class="space-below2">Some spiders living on plants make flat tubes,
in which they wait for insects, and also hide while moulting, or laying
eggs. Others make, especially about the breeding-time, bags of silk on
plants, or under stones, in which the egg-cocoons are finally spun.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_23" id="FIG_23"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_23.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="345" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 23.</b></p>
</div>

<p><i>Dolomedes</i> makes among grass and shrubs, in meadows, a great nest,
four or five inches in diameter, <a href="#FIG_23">Fig. 23</a>, in which is
the egg-cocoon. The young hatch and ramble about in this nest for some time.
The spider remains near, usually holding on under the nest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WATER-SPIDER.</h3>

<p>There is one spider that makes a bag of silk, something like those
just mentioned, on water-plants, and lives in it under water, as in a
diving-bell; the opening being below, so that the air cannot escape.
Mr. Bell, in “The Journal of the Linnæan Society,” vol. i., 1857,
describes the filling of these nests with air by the spider. After the
nest had been made as large as half an acorn, she went to the surface,
and returned, fourteen times successively, and each time brought down a
bubble of air, which she let escape into the nest. The bubble was held
by the spinnerets and two hind-feet, which were crossed over them; and
the method of catching it was the following: The spider climbed up on
threads or plants nearly to the surface, and put the end of the abdomen
out of water for an instant, and then jerked it under, at the same time
crossing the hind-legs quickly over it. She then walked down the plants
to her nest, opened her hind-feet, and let the bubble go.</p>

<p>The water-spiders run about on water-plants, and catch the insects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
which live among them. They lay their eggs in the nest; and the young
come out, and spin little nests of their own, as soon as they are big
enough. Their hairs keep the skin from becoming wet as they go through
the water; and in the nest they are as dry as if it were under a stone,
or in a hole on land.</p>

<h3>COBWEBS.</h3>

<p>The simple nests and tubes that have been described are made by
spiders, most of which spin no other webs. The larger and better known
cobwebs for catching insects are made by comparatively few species. On
damp mornings in summer the grass-fields are seen to be half covered
with flat webs, from an inch or two to a foot in diameter, which are
considered by the weatherwise as signs of a fair day. These webs remain
on the grass all the time, but only become visible from a distance when
the dew settles on them. <a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24</a> is a diagram of
one of these nests, supposed, for convenience, to be spun between pegs
instead of grass. The flat part consists of strong threads from peg
to peg, crossed by finer ones, which the spider spins with the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
hind-spinnerets, <a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>, swinging them from
side to side, and laying down a band of threads at each stroke. The web
is so close and tight, that one can hear the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> footsteps of the spider
as she runs about on it. At one side of the web is a tube leading down
among the grass-stems. At the top the spider usually stands, just out
of sight, and waits for something to light on the web, when she runs
out, and snatches it, and carries it into the tube to eat. If any thing
too large walks through the web, she turns around, and retreats out
of the lower end of the tube, and can seldom be found afterward. In
favorable places these webs remain through the whole season, and are
enlarged, as the spider grows, by additions on the outer edges, and are
supported by threads running up into the neighboring plants. Similar
webs are made by several house-spiders, and are enlarged, if let alone,
till they are a foot or two feet wide, and remain till they collect
dirt enough to tear them down by its weight.</p>

<p>Nearly all spiders that make cobwebs live under them, back downward;
and many are so formed, that they can hardly walk right side up. The
spiders of the genus <i>Linyphia</i> make a flat or curved sheet of web,
supported by threads above and below; the spider standing, usually,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
underneath in some corner, out of sight. <i>Linyphia Marmorata</i> makes a
dome-shaped web, <a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>, supported by threads that extend
up into the bushes two or three feet. The spider stands under the middle of the
dome, where it draws in a small circle of web with its feet. The upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
threads of the web interfere with the wings of small insects flying
between them, and they fall down to the dome below, where they are
seized, and pulled through the nearest hole. <i>Linyphia communis</i> makes
a double web, <a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>. The spider stands under the
upper sheet, which curves a little downward. What the use of the lower
web is, is not easily seen. Either of these spiders, when frightened,
leaps out of the web to the ground; but <i>Linyphia communis</i> must go to
the edge before she can clear herself, and so is easily caught in her
own web.</p>

<p>A little spider, <i>Argyrodes</i>, belonging to the same family, lives among
the upper threads of webs of this kind, without being troubled by the
owner. It resembles in size and color the scales of pine-buds that
often fall in the web, and may easily be mistaken for them. It probably
spins a few threads of its own among the borrowed ones, and does, at
times, make a separate web of its own.</p>

<p>The webs of <i>Theridion</i> usually have at some part a tent, or at least
a thicker portion, under which the spider stands; and from this run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
irregularly simple threads, crossing each other in all directions, and
held in place by threads above and below. Such irregular webs are made
often in houses by <i>Theridion vulgare</i>, Hentz, in corners of rooms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
under furniture, and in cellar-stairways. The same spider spins
occasionally out of doors on fences, but never on plants. When it
has caught an insect, and tied it up, it hoists it up into the web,
sometimes a considerable distance.</p>

<p>They do this by fastening to it threads from above, which, as they dry,
contract, and pull it up a little. They keep on bringing down more and
more threads, until the insect is at last hoisted to the top of the
web, where they can suck it without exposing themselves.</p>

<p><i>Pholcus</i>, the long-legged cellar-spider, makes an irregular web of
this kind, and has a curious habit when alarmed. It hangs down by its
long legs, <a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27</a>, and swings its body around in
a circle, so fast that it can hardly be seen. <a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27</a>,
<i>a</i>, represents the spider as seen from below; and the dotted
circle shows the path in which it revolves.</p>

<h3>ROUND WEBS.</h3>

<p>These well-known cobwebs are made by the family <i>Epeiridæ</i>,
<a href="#FIG_1">Figs. 1</a>, <a href="#FIG_4">&nbsp;4</a>;
and the process of making them by the common spider, from which these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
figures are drawn, can be easily observed in any garden. They generally
choose for their web a window-frame or fence, or some such open wooden
structure, where there is a hole or crack in which they can hide in the
daytime.</p>

</div>

<p>The spider begins by spinning a line across where the web is to be, and
attaches another to it near the middle. She carries the last line along,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
holding it off with one of the hind-feet, and makes it fast an inch
or two from one end of the first; then she goes back to the centre,
attaches another line, which she carries off in another direction,
and fastens; and so on, until all the rays of the web, <a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
are finished. She stops occasionally at the centre, turns around, and
pulls at the threads one after another, and spins here and there short
cross-lines to hold them more firmly. She seems, by thus feeling the
rays, to decide where to put in the next one, and does it always in
such a way as to keep tight what has been done before. When the rays
are finished to her satisfaction, the spider begins at the centre to
spin a spiral line across them, <a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28</a>, <i>a</i>,
<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>; the turns of the spiral being as far apart as the spider can
conveniently reach. She climbs across from one ray to the next, holding
her thread carefully off with one of the hind-feet, till she gets to
the right point, and then turns up her abdomen, and touches the ray
with her spinnerets, thus fastening the cross-thread to it. The figure
shows her in this position. When this spiral has been carried to the
outside of the web, the spider begins there another and closer one,
<a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28</a>, of thread of a different kind. While the
first thread was smooth, the latter is covered with a sticky liquid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
which soon collects on it in drops, and makes it adhere to any thing
that touches it. After going round a few times, this spiral crosses the
one that was spun first, or would, if the spider allowed it to; but,
as she comes to the old spiral, she bites it away, leaving only little
rags, <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>, <i>b</i>, attached to the rays, which
may be seen in the finished web. By beginning thus at the outside,
the spider is able to cover the whole web with adhesive threads, and,
without stepping on it, take her usual place in the centre. She usually
is careful enough to spin beforehand a thread from the centre to her
nest, and sometimes stays there, with one foot on the thread, so as to
feel if any thing is caught in the web. When she feels a shake, she
runs down to the centre, feels the rays to see where the insect is,
and runs out, and seizes it, or ties it up as described on <a href="#Page_43">page 43</a>.
We have described the web as consisting of one regular spiral; but this
is seldom the case. It is usually wider on one side than the other, or
below than above, as in <a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28</a>, where outside
the spirals are several loops going partly round the web. The web of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Zilla consists entirely of such loops going three-quarters round the web, and
returning, leaving a segment without any cross-threads, in which is
the line from the centre to the spider’s nest, <a href="#FIG_29">Fig. 29</a>.
The spider is shown carrying a fly to its nest attached to the
spinnerets; and, if this is its usual habit, the web with an open
segment is certainly more convenient than a complete one.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
The web of <i>Nephila plumipes</i>, described by Wilder, consists also of
loops running round about quarter of a circle, <a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30</a>;
and in this web the smooth cross-lines which are first spun are not removed,
but remain after it is finished. <a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31</a> shows
part of one side of a web; the arrows marking the smooth thread, and
the direction in which it was spun.</p>

<p><i>Argiope</i>, the large black and yellow autumn spiders, cross the middle
of the web with a zig-zag band of white silk, which, as the web is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
obliquely hung, partly conceals the spider under it. These spiders also
spin each side of the web, and two or three inches from it, a screen of
irregular threads of unknown use.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_31" id="FIG_31"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_31.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="629" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 31.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The round-web spiders are said to repair their webs by tearing out a
dirty, tangled piece, and putting a new one in its place. Wilder says
that <i>Nephila plumipes</i> tears off and replaces half the web at one
time. <i>Epeira vulgaris</i> often takes away an old web, and puts a new one
in the same place, tearing down the old in pieces, and putting in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
rays of the new as it goes along. The spider walks on the nearest sound
thread, and gathers in with her front-feet as much old web as she can
tear off, and rolls it up with her palpi and mandibles into a ball,
and, when it is tight enough not to stick to the web, drops it. As she
walks along, gathering up the old web in front, she at the same time
spins a new thread behind, and, when she gets to a suitable place,
makes it fast as one of the rays of the new web. The common story has
it, that the spider eats the old web. She certainly gathers it up in
her mouth, and sometimes throws it away at once, but at other times
sits and chews it a long time, with apparent pleasure.</p>

<p>Most of the <i>Epeiridæ</i> are brightly colored, and make no attempt at
concealment when in the web. Others have odd shapes and colors, and
hang in the web in such positions that they look like any thing but
animals. Some species draw up their legs against their triangular
abdomens, and look like bits of bark fallen into the web. Others are
long and slender, and when at rest, either in the web or out, lay their
legs close together before and behind their bodies, so as to look like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
straws. Others have oddly shaped abdomens, as <a href="#FIG_32">Fig. 32</a>,
under which the rest of the body is partly concealed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_32" id="FIG_32"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_32.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="670" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 32.</b></p>
</div>

<p><i>Epeira caudata</i>, a common gray spider, living in the wood, collects
pieces of insects and other rubbish, and arranges it in a line up and
down, across the centre of the web. The spider stands in the centre,
and from a short distance can hardly be distinguished from the rubbish.
She also hides her cocoons in the web, in the same line of dirt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>The size of the web is usually proportioned to that of the spider; but
<i>Epeira displicata</i>, which is quarter of an inch long, makes a web only
two or three inches in diameter, on the ends of branches of bushes,
where it is shaken about, and sometimes blown to pieces, by the wind.</p>

<p>As the spider stands in her web, and feels a slight shake, such as
would be caused by a sudden wind, she draws her legs together, pulling
the rays tighter, and so making the whole web steady. If, however, the
spider is frightened, and has no time to escape, she throws her body
back and forth as a man does in a swing, and thus shakes the web so
rapidly, that the spider can hardly be seen. The most usual habit, when
alarmed, is to drop to the ground, and lie there as if dead.</p>

<h3>USE OF SPIDER’S SILK.</h3>

<p>Various attempts have been made to use the silk of spiders, and chiefly
that of the large round-web spiders, for practical purposes, either by
carding the cocoons, or by drawing the thread directly from the spider.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
The latest experiments and plans for this purpose are those of
Professor Wilder in “The Galaxy,” vol. viii. He shows how <i>Nephila
plumipes</i> might be raised in large numbers, each spider kept by herself
in a wire ring surrounded by water, fed with flies bred for the purpose
from old meat, and milked every day of their thread. Each cocoon of
this spider contains from five hundred to a thousand eggs. The young
live together for two or three weeks, spin a web in common, and eat
one another, or any small insects that come in their way. Then they
begin to scatter, and each builds her own web; so that from this time
they must be kept separate, or they would eat one another. Every day or
two, each spider should be taken down, put into a pair of stocks, and
the thread pulled out till it stops coming. In this way Wilder thinks
an ounce of thread could be got from each spider during the summer.
The thread is from a seven-thousandth to a four-thousandth of an inch
thick, and much smoother and more brightly colored, as well as finer,
than that of the silk-worm. Several threads would have to be twisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
together to get one of manageable size. The principal difficulties are
the space needed for keeping each spider by herself, and the amount of
labor needed to provide them with living insects for food, and to draw
out the silk, which would make it too expensive to use.</p>

<h3>CURLED WEBS.</h3>

<p>There is a family of spiders called by Blackwall <i>Ciniflonidæ</i>,
<a href="#Page_17">see p. 17</a>, which, besides the usual plain thread, make a
peculiar kind of their own. They have in front of the spinnerets, <a href="#FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>,
an additional spinning-organ called the cribellum, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
It is covered with fine tubes, much finer than those of the spinnerets,
set close together.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_33" id="FIG_33"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_33.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="627" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 33.</b></p>
</div>

<p>They also have on the last joint but one of the hind-legs a comb of
stiff hairs, called the calamistrum, <a href="#FIG_34">Fig. 34</a>,
on the upper side.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_34" id="FIG_34"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_34.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="185" />

    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 35.</b></p>
</div>

<p>When they spin their peculiar web, they turn one of the hind-legs
across under the spinnerets, so that the calamistrum is just under
the cribellum, and the foot rests on the opposite leg, <a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35</a>.
The hind-legs are then moved rapidly back and forth; so that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
calamistrum combs out from the spinning-tubes, and at the same time
tangles a band of fine threads, C. This band is laid along, and
attached here and there to a plain thread, A, B, so as to make it
adhere more readily to an insect that happens to touch it. As one leg
gets tired, they change, and work with the other. In the webs of these
spiders this adhesive band can be seen with the naked eye, running
about, as in <a href="#FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>. The webs are usually irregular,
and shaped to fit the place where they are built, but have, in
some part, a tube somewhat like that of the grass spider,
<a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24</a>, where the owner hides. Sometimes
they are more or less regular in structure, some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
threads being parallel, and crossed by shorter ones at regular
intervals, <a href="#FIG_37">Fig. 37</a>. Others are circular, with
a tube in the centre which runs into a crack, and from which radiate
irregularly the principal threads of the web. Such webs are sometimes
very numerous on stone buildings, and, as they collect large quantities
of dust, seriously disfigure them. The webs alone, when clean, would
not be noticed.</p>

<h3>THE TRIANGLE SPIDER.</h3>

<p>Among those spiders that use the calamistrum is one which makes a
web unlike any other. It has been described by Professor Wilder, in
the “Popular Science Monthly” for April, 1875, under the name of the
“triangle spider.” It lives usually among the dead branches around the
lower part of pine and spruce trees, and is colored so like the bark,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
that when it stands, as it usually does, on the end of a branch, it
is easily mistaken for a part of it. The web seems to be made in the
night. Wilder saw them early in the morning; and I, in the evening,
between sunset and dark. A single thread five or six inches long runs
from the spider’s roost; and from its extremity radiate four branches,
attached to various twigs in the neighborhood, <a href="#FIG_38">Fig. 38</a>,
AE, AF, AG, AH.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_38" id="FIG_38"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_38.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="602" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 38.</b></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
The spider begins to cross them with adhesive threads near the end
of the upper ray at S′. After fastening the end of the thread, she
walks along toward the centre, scratching away all the time with her
calamistrum, till she comes to a place, 5, where she can cross to the
next ray. She crosses over, and goes outward toward S″, the thread
shrinking as she goes, until, when she arrives at S″, it is just long
enough to reach across to S′. She fastens it by laying it along the ray
for a short distance, and goes inward again till she reaches 7, where
she crosses to the next ray; and so on till the thread is finished to
S‴′. Here she stops spinning, and goes up the lower ray to A, and along
the upper one to 4, where she starts another cross-thread. This goes on
till the whole web is filled, as in <a href="#FIG_39">Fig. 39</a>,
nearly to the centre.</p>

<p>When the web is finished, the spider goes up the thread A <i>o</i>, to
within an inch or so of the twig to which it is fastened; turns round,
and takes hold of the thread with her front-feet; then pulls herself
backward with her hind-feet up to the twig. She thus tightens the web,
and draws up a loop of thread between her front and hind feet,
<a href="#FIG_39">Fig. 39</a>, lower figure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_39" id="FIG_39"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_39.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="495" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 39.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The net is now set for use, and she stands
holding it till something touches it; then she
lets go with her hind-legs, and the net springs
forward, bringing more threads into contact
with the insect, and sliding the spider along the
line toward A. If she thinks it worth while,
she draws up another loop, and snaps the web
again. When she is satisfied that the insect is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
caught, she gathers up part of the web till she comes to him, covers
him with silk, and carries him up to her roost.</p>

<p>There are other spiders of this group that make round webs, just like
those of the <i>Epeiridæ</i>, <a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28</a>, except in the
adhesive threads being spun with the calamistrum.</p>

<h3>FLYING SPIDERS.</h3>

<p>Often, in summer, the bushes are covered with threads, attached by one
end, blowing out in the wind; and bits of cobweb are blowing about,
with occasionally a spider attached. To account for such threads,
curious theories have been thought of; among others, that spiders are
able to force the thread from their spinnerets, like water from a
syringe, in any direction they choose.</p>

<p>If a spider be put on a stick surrounded by water, she manages, in
course of time, to get a thread to some object beyond, and to escape by
it. To find out how this is done, Mr. Blackwall tried some experiments.
He put spiders on sticks in vessels of water, and they ran up and down,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
unable to escape as long as the air in the room was still. But, if
a draught of air passed the spider, she turned her head toward it,
and opened her spinnerets in the opposite direction. If the draught
continued, a thread was drawn out by it, which at length caught upon
something, when the spider drew it tight, and escaped on it. If the air
was kept still, or the spider covered with a glass, she remained on the
stick till taken off.</p>

<p>These experiments have been repeated, and show that the spider does not
shoot or throw the web in any way, but takes advantage of currents of
air, and allows threads to be blown out to a considerable distance.</p>

<p>There is a still more curious use of this method of spinning threads;
that is, in flying. Small spiders, especially on fine days in the
autumn, get up on the tops of bushes and fences, each apparently
anxious to get as high as possible, and there raise themselves up on
tiptoe, and turn their bodies up, as in <a href="#FIG_40">Fig. 40</a>,
with their heads toward the wind, and spinnerets open. A thread soon
blows out from the spinnerets, and, if the current of air continues,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
spins out to a length of two or three yards, and then offers enough
resistance to the wind to carry the spider away with it up into the
air. As soon as she is clear, the spider turns around, and grasps the
thread with her feet, and seems to be very comfortable and contented
till she strikes against something. Sometimes they rise rapidly,
and are soon out of sight; at other times blow along just above the
ground.</p>

    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 40.</b></p>
</div>

<p>This habit is not confined to any particular kinds of spiders, but is
practised by many small species of <i>Erigone</i>, and by the young of many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
spiders of all families, that, when adult, would be too large for it.
The majority of the spiders flying in autumn are the young of several
species of <i>Lycosa</i>, that seem to spend the greater part of October and
November trying to get as far above ground as possible. The best places
to watch them are garden-fences in cities, where they often swarm, and
can be more distinctly seen than on bushes. Large numbers can always
be seen, for example, on the fences around the Common in Boston, every
fine day in autumn, until there has been a long period of cold weather.
Other species fly in the early part of summer.</p>

<p>Mr. Blackwall observed in Manchester, Eng., Oct. 1, 1826, a calm sunny
day, that, just before noon, the fields and hedges were covered over
with cobwebs. So thick were they, that, in crossing a small pasture,
his feet were covered with them. They had evidently been made in a very
short time, as early in the morning they were not conspicuous enough
to attract his attention, and the day before could not have existed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
all, as a high wind blew all day. At the same time large rags of web
were floating about in the air, one measuring five feet long, and
several inches wide. These appeared to be not formed in the air, but
torn from grass and bushes, where they were produced by the tangling of
many threads which had been spun separately. They kept rising all the
forenoon, and in the afternoon came down again. Not one in twenty had
a spider on it. Similar large webs were observed by Lincecum in Texas,
and supposed by him to be balloons spun purposely by the spiders.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, in the journal of the voyage of “The Beagle,” says, that
when anchored in the River Plata, sixty miles from shore, he has seen
the rigging covered with cobwebs, and the air full of pieces of web
floating about. The spiders, however, when they struck the ship, were
always hanging from single threads, and never to the floating webs.</p>

<p>A recent account of the signs of weather-changes near the southern
coast of the United States mentions as one of them cobwebs in the rigging.</p>

<p>It is still unexplained how the thread starts from the spinnerets. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
has been often asserted that the spider fastens the thread by the end,
and allows a loop to blow out in the wind; but, in most cases, this is
certainly not done, only one thread being visible. Sometimes, while
a thread is blown from the hinder spinnerets, another from the front
spinnerets is kept fast to the ground, <a href="#FIG_41">Fig. 41</a>;
so that, when the spider blows away, it draws out a thread behind it
entirely independent of the one from which it hangs.</p>

    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 41.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, instead of a single thread, several are blown out at once,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
like a long brush, as in <a href="#FIG_42">Fig. 42</a>, which represents, four
times enlarged, an unusually large spider just before blowing off a fence.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>CHAPTER IV.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">GROWTH OF SPIDERS.</span></h2></div>

<p>Persons unfamiliar with spiders find it hard to tell young from old,
and male from female. This is caused, in part, by the great differences
between different ages and sexes of the same spider, on account of
which they are supposed to belong to distinct species.</p>

<p>The adult males and females are easily distinguished from each other,
and from the young, by the complete development of organs peculiar to
each sex, which will be described further on.</p>

<p>The males are usually smaller than the females, and have, in proportion
to their size, smaller abdomens and longer legs. They are usually
darker colored, especially on the head and front part of the body; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
markings which are distinct in the female run together and become
darker in the male. In most species these differences are not great;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
but in some no one would ever suppose, without other evidence, that the
males and females had any relationship to each other. The most extreme
cases of this kind are <i>Argiope</i> and <i>Nephila</i>, where the male
is about a tenth as large as the female. <a href="#FIG_43">Fig. 43</a>
represents male and female of <i>Nephila plumipes</i> described by Wilder.</p>

</div>

<p>The female of one of the common crab spiders is white as milk, with a
crimson stripe on each side of the abdomen; while the male is a little
brown-and-yellow spider, with dark markings of a pattern common in the
family to which it belongs.</p>

<p>In the genus <i>Erigone</i>, which includes the smallest known spiders,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the males often have curious humps and horns on their heads, <a href="#FIG_44">Fig. 44</a>.
The most extreme example is <a href="#FIG_45">Fig. 45</a>, where the eyes are
carried up on the end of the horn. The females of all these species have plain
round heads; and what use the humps are to the males nobody knows.</p>

<p>The peculiar organs by which the adult males and females can always be
distinguished are, in the males, the palpal organs, on the ends of the
palpi; and, in the females, the epigynum, <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<h3>PALPAL ORGANS.</h3>

<p>As the male spider gets nearly full grown, the terminal joints of the
palpi become swollen, and, after the last moult, the palpal organs are
uncovered.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_46" id="FIG_46"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_46.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="256" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 46.</b></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
The simplest form of palpal organ is found in the large <i>Mygalidæ</i>,
<a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a>. It consists of a hard bulb, <a href="#FIG_46">Fig. 46</a>,
drawn out to a point, in which is a small hole leading to a sac within.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_47" id="FIG_47"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_47.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="647" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 47.</b></p>
</div>

<p>In most spiders the terminal joint is flattened, and has a hollow on
the under side, in which the palpal organ is partly concealed. The bulb
is flattened to fit this hollow; and the point of it is prolonged into
a distinct tube of various shapes, furnished with numerous spines and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
appendages. <a href="#FIG_47">Fig. 47</a> is the palpal organ of
<i>Epeira vulgaris</i> flattened out, and made transparent. The internal sac
is shown at <i>a</i>; and the tube from it <i>b</i> runs round the inside of the
bulb, and ends at the opening <i>c</i>. The outside of the organ has various
horns and appendages. <a href="#FIG_48">Fig. 48</a> is the palpus of another
spider, where the outer tube is so long, that it is coiled up over the basal
part of the bulb; and the end rests on a strong spine at one side of the palpus.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_48" id="FIG_48"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_48.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="601" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 48.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Not only the terminal joints of the palpi, but also the next, and
sometimes next two joints, are modified in shape, with the development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of the palpal organ, <a href="#FIG_48">Fig. 48</a>. The shape of these
organs is very constant in the same species of spider, and thus becomes
one of the most convenient marks of such a group.</p>

<h3>THE EPIGYNUM.</h3>

<p>When the female spider is nearly full grown, there appears a hard,
swollen place just in front of the opening of the ovaries, <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>;
and, after the last moult, the epigynum is uncovered at this place. The
epigynum, <a href="#FIG_49">Fig. 49</a>, consists of two spermathecæ, E,
which connect by two little tubes, H, H, with the oviduct near its mouth, and
by two larger tubes, D, with the outside of the spider. The mouths of these larger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
tubes are often surrounded by various hard appendages to support
and guide the palpal organs when the latter are thrust into them.
These parts, like the palpal organs, furnish convenient marks for
distinguishing species. The spermathecæ, E, vary but little in shape
in different spiders; but the tubes H and D are often lengthened,
and twisted into shapes nearly as complicated as those of the palpal
organs. <a href="#FIG_50">Fig. 50</a> is the epigynum of a small
<i>Theridion</i>, where the arrangement of parts can be very distinctly
seen. E, E, are the spermathecæ; H, H, the tubes opening into the
oviduct; and D, D, the tubes opening outward. <a href="#FIG_51">Fig. 51</a>
is the epigynum of another closely allied species, where the tubes D, D,
are very much elongated and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
twisted up, corresponding to the long discharge-tube of the palpal
organ of the male of the same spider, Fig. 48.</p>

</div>

<h3>USE OF THE PALPAL ORGANS AND EPIGYNUM.</h3>

<p>When the reproductive cells of the male spider are mature, he
discharges the liquid containing them on a little web spun for the
purpose; dips his palpal organs into it, and in a few moments takes up
the whole, it is supposed, into the little sacs, <a
href="#FIG_47">Figs. 47</a>, <a href="#FIG_48">48</a>, inside the
bulb; then he seeks the female, and inserts the palpal organs into her
epigynum. The soft part at the base of the organ swells up, and presses
in the discharge-tube, and probably forces out the contents of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the bulb into the spermathecæ, E, E, from which it escapes, in course
of time, by the tubes, H, H, into the oviduct, and fertilizes the eggs
about the time they are laid.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_52" id="FIG_52"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_52.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="248" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 52.</b></p>
</div>

<p>One palpal organ is usually inserted at a time, and, after a while,
taken out, and replaced by the other; this change being repeated many
times by the same spider. Among the <i>Lycosidæ</i>, <a href="#FIG_10">Fig. 10</a>,
the male leaps on the back of the female, and is carried about by her,
<a href="#FIG_52">Fig. 52</a>. He reaches down at the side of her
abdomen, and inserts his palpi in the epigynum underneath. In
<i>Linyphia</i> and <i>Theridion</i> the male and female live peaceably together
for a long time in the same web. The male reaches from in front under
the female, <a href="#FIG_53">Fig. 53</a>, and inserts his palpal
organs, one after the other, for hours together. In <i>Agalena</i> the male
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
is the stronger of the two sexes. He takes the female in his mandibles,
and lays her on one side, <a href="#FIG_54">Fig. 54</a>, and inserts one
of his palpi. After a time, he rises on tiptoe, turns her around and
over, so that she lies on the other side, with her head in the opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
direction, and inserts the other palpus. The female lies as though
dead. In <i>Nephila</i> and <i>Argiope</i>, where the male is very small, he
stands on the upper edge of the web while the female is in her usual
position in the centre. After feeling the web with his feet for
some time, he runs down to the centre so lightly as not to disturb
the female, and climbs about over her body for some minutes, in an
apparently aimless way. She takes no notice of him at first; but at
length, especially if he approach the under side of her abdomen, she
turns, and snaps at him with her jaws. He is usually nimble enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
dodge between her legs, and drop out of the web, and, after a while,
climbs up to the top, and begins over again. In these encounters the
males are often injured; they frequently lose some of their legs: and I
have seen one, that had only four out of his eight left, still standing
up to his work.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_53" id="FIG_53"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_53.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="335" />

    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 55.</b></p>
</div>

<p>At length the male succeeds in getting under the female’s abdomen, and
inserting his palpi into the epigynum. <a href="#FIG_55">Fig. 55</a> shows
the female hanging in the web, with the male at <i>a</i>, with his legs
grasped around her abdomen.</p>

<p>The habits of these spiders furnish the grounds for the popular story,
that female spiders regularly eat the males. No doubt it occasionally
happens, where the female is the larger of the two; but in many species
they live together for some time in the same web, or in a nest spun for
the purpose; in some cases, before the female has reached the adult state.</p>

<h3>LAYING EGGS.</h3>

<p>When the eggs are mature, the female proceeds, like the male, to make
a little web, and lays the eggs on it. Then she covers them over with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
silk, forming a cocoon, in which the young remain till some time after
they are hatched. The laying of the eggs is seldom seen; for the spider
does it in the night, or in retired places; and often, in confinement,
refuses to lay at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_56" id="FIG_56"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_56.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="330" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 56.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The female <i>Drassus</i>, <a href="#FIG_56">Fig. 56</a>, spins a little
web A across her nest, and drops the eggs E on it, as in the figure.
They are soft, and mixed with liquid, and are discharged in one or two
drops, like jelly. They quickly soak up the liquid, and become dry on
the surface, sometimes adhering slightly together.</p>

<p>After the eggs are laid, the spider covers them with silk, drawing the
threads over them from one side to the other, and fastening them to the
edges of the web below. When the covering is complete, she bites off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the threads that hold the cocoon to the nest, and finishes off the
edges with her jaws.</p>

<p>The <i>Lycosidæ</i> make their cocoons in the same way, but rounder,
and showing only slightly the seam where the upper part was attached to
the lower.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_57" id="FIG_57"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_57.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="188" />

    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 58.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Lycosas</i> carry their cocoons about, attached to the spinnerets,
as in <a href="#FIG_57">Fig. 57</a>, bumping them over the stones without
injury to the young inside.</p>

<p>Many spiders make their cocoons against a flat surface, where they
remain attached by one side. <i>Attus mystaceus</i> spins, before laying,
a thick nest of white silk on the under side of a stone. In this she
thickens a circular patch on the upper side, next the stone, and
discharges her eggs upward against it, <a href="#FIG_58">Fig. 58</a>.
They adhere, and are covered with white silk. I once had a spider of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
this species lay her eggs, in confinement, in a nest the under side of
which had been cut away. Instead of completing the cocoon properly, she
ate the eggs immediately after laying. <i>Epeira strix</i> spins, before
laying, a bunch of loose silk, <a href="#FIG_59">Fig. 59</a>. She
touches her spinnerets, as in the figure on the left, draws them away a
short distance, at the same time pressing upward with the hind-feet, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
in the figure on the right; then moves the abdomen a little sidewise,
and attaches the band of threads so as to form a loop. She keeps making
these loops, turning round, at the same time, so as to form a rounded
bunch of them, into the middle of which she afterwards lays the eggs,
as in <a href="#FIG_60">Fig. 60</a>. The eggs, which are like a drop
of jelly, are held up by the loose threads till the spider has time
to spin under them a covering of stronger silk. <i>Epeira vulgaris</i>
makes a similar cocoon upward, downward, or sidewise, as may be most
convenient.</p>

<p>Most of the <i>Theridiidæ</i> make cocoons of loose silk, held up in the web
by numerous threads. Some hang the cocoon by a stem, <a href="#FIG_61-62">Fig. 61</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>The large species of <i>Argiope</i> makes a big pear-shaped cocoon hanging
in grass or bushes, <a href="#FIG_61-62">Fig. 62</a>. A stem of loose
brown silk is first made, and under this the eggs attached (at any rate
this had been done in one which had been abandoned unfinished); then
a cup-shaped piece is made under the eggs; the bunch of loose silk is
spun over all, and finally the paper-like shell.</p>

<h3>ESCAPE FROM THE COCOON.</h3>

<p>These cocoons of <i>Argiope</i> are made late in the summer, and the young
stay in them till the next season. Out of six hundred cocoons collected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
by Wilder in the spring, less than a quarter were entire, the rest
being pierced, or torn in some way, by birds or insects; so that the
spiders were saved the trouble of gnawing their way out, as they can if
obliged to.</p>

<p>I once noticed a small <i>Theridion</i> gnawing at its soft cocoon, and
found that one side had been made in this way much thinner than the
rest of the cocoon. I put her, with the cocoon, in a bottle where I
could watch her; and she soon commenced biting again, and kept it up
the rest of the day. The following night the young came out.</p>

<p>Many spiders remain by their cocoons till the young come out; but other
species, making similar ones, go away, or die, and the young get out
themselves when they are old enough.</p>

<p>The young of <i>Micaria</i> cut a smooth round hole in their paper-like
cocoon, just large enough for them to come out one by one.</p>

<h3>PARASITES.</h3>

<p>The eggs in the cocoon are very liable to be eaten by parasitic
insects. Certain wingless <i>Hymenoptera</i> are always hunting around in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
neighborhood of spiders’ nests, and may sometimes be seen trying to
stick their ovipositor through a cocoon. If they succeed, their eggs
hatch before the spiders, and eat the latter up. Other parasites lay
eggs on the backs of young spiders, and the larva lives attached to the
outside till it gets nearly as large as the spider itself.</p>

<h3>GROWTH IN THE EGG.</h3>

<p>The egg of a spider, like that of any other animal, is a cell which
separates from the body of the female, and afterwards unites with one
or more cells which have separated from the body of the male. This
fertilization of the eggs probably takes place when they have reached
their full size, and are about to be laid.</p>

<p>After the eggs are laid and hardened, it is very easy to watch their
development. They grow just as well anywhere else as in the cocoon,
and, in order to see through the shell, it is only necessary to cover
the egg to be examined, with oil, alcohol, or any liquid that will wet it.</p>

    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 63.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Just after it is laid, the egg looks like <a href="#FIG_63">Fig. 63</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
<i>a</i>; or, if the egg is more opaque, only the ends of the lobes can be
seen like irregular lumps. The first sign of growth is the division
into two, <a href="#FIG_63">Fig. 63</a>, <i>b</i>. These divide into four,
into eight, and so on, <a href="#FIG_63">Fig. 63</a>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>. At
first the divisions are all alike; but at length they divide into two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
kinds,—small ones, with a dark spot in the middle, which cover the
outside of the egg; and larger ones that occupy the inside. <a href="#FIG_63">Fig. 63</a>,
<i>e</i>, shows an egg at this stage, where the large inner cells show
through the layer of outer ones. <a href="#FIG_63">Fig. 63</a>, <i>f</i>,
is a section of the same egg. The stages shown in <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are
seldom clearly seen, because the divisions are crowded together and too
opaque; but <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> can be watched in any common spider’s eggs. The
rate of growth varies according to circumstances. Some eggs laid in
autumn develop slowly all winter, while others laid in summer are ready
to hatch in a fortnight.</p>

<p>In the eggs of the long-legged cellar spider, laid in June, in about
four or five days the young spider becomes lengthened out into a sort
of barrel shape; and six whitish rings run half way round it, on each
of which appears soon after a pair of little knobs, one each side, <a href="#FIG_64">Fig. 64</a>,
<i>a</i>. These are the six segments of the thorax, and the six pairs of
limbs; and their gradual growth is shown in <a href="#FIG_64">Fig. 64</a>,
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>. In <i>a</i> there is no sign of a head or abdomen, except
the more opaque ends of the embryo; but shortly after there appears an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
opaque knob at one end, <a href="#FIG_64">Fig. 64</a>, <i>b</i>, under which
is a pair of little knobs, such as appeared at first on the thoracic
segments; then appear two pairs, then three, and so on, till there are
six pairs, which mark the six segments of the abdomen. Up to this time,
the embryo has been rolled up with the under side outward; but now it
begins to turn, and in a day or two has its back outward, <a href="#FIG_64">Fig. 64</a>,
<i>c</i>. The constriction between the thorax and abdomen begins about this time;
and in a few days more the spider is ready to hatch, <a href="#FIG_64">Fig. 64</a>,
<i>d</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<h3>YOUNG SPIDERS.</h3>

<p>The hatching occupies a day or two. The shell, or rather skin, cracks
along the lines between the legs, and comes off in rags; and the spider
slowly stretches itself, and creeps about. It is now pale and soft, and
without any hairs or spines, and only small claws on its feet; but, in
a few days, it gets rid of another skin, and now begins to look like a
spider. The eyes become darker colored; marks on the thorax become more
distinct, and a dark stripe appears across the edge of each segment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the abdomen. The hairs are long, and few in number, and arranged in
rows across the abdomen and along the middle of the thorax, <a href="#FIG_65">Fig. 65</a>.
Before the next moult, they usually leave the cocoon, and for a time
live together in a web spun in common. A brood of young <i>Epeira</i> may
often be seen looking like a ball of wool in the top of a bush, while
below them, connected by threads to their roost, are the skins left at
their second moult, and farther down, also connected by threads, the
cocoon with the first skins.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="FIG_65" id="FIG_65"></a>
    <img src="images/fig_65.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="554" />
    <p class="f150 space-below2"><b>Fig. 65.</b></p>
</div>

<p><i>Dolomedes</i> spins a nest in which the young live for a while after
hatching.</p>

<p>The young of the running spiders, <i>Lycosidæ</i>, when they come out of the
cocoon get on their mother’s back, and are carried round by her for
some time.</p>

<p>Where large broods of young spiders live together, they soon begin
to eat one another; and, if kept in confinement, one or two out of a
cocoon full, may be raised without any other food.</p>

<p>Wilder noticed this in <i>Nephila plumipes</i>, and believes it is the
natural habit of young spiders, and not the result of confinement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>As spiders grow larger, they have to moult from time to time. This
process is shown by Wilder in <a href="#FIG_66-67">Figs. 66, 67</a>; and
I have seen the same operation in <i>Argiope</i>. The spider hangs herself
by a thread from the spinnerets to the centre of the web. The skin
cracks around the thorax, just over the first joints of the legs; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the top part falls forward, being held only at the front edge. The
skin of the abdomen breaks irregularly along the sides and back, and
shrinks together in a bunch. The spider now hangs by a short thread
from the spinnerets, and works to free her legs from the old skin,
<a href="#FIG_66-67">Fig. 66</a>. This takes about quarter of an hour;
and then she drops down, hanging by her spinnerets like a wet rag,
<a href="#FIG_66-67">Fig. 67</a>.</p>

<p>If struck while in this condition, she can do nothing, not even
draw her legs away. After ten or fifteen minutes, the legs begin to
strengthen; and she draws them gradually up toward her, works them up
and down a few times, and is soon able to get into the web again.</p>

<p>Blackwall observed nine moults in <i>Tegenaria civilis</i>, a spider that
lives several years. Many species, and among them some of the largest,
live only one year, hatching in the winter, leaving the cocoon in early
summer, and laying eggs and dying in autumn. Other species seem to
require two years for their growth; hatching in summer, passing their
first winter half grown, growing up the next summer, but laying no eggs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
till the second spring. Some species are found adult at all seasons,
and may live several years.</p>

<p>After spiders have passed their second moult, they usually live in the
same places, and follow the same habits, as the adults.</p>

<p>The running spiders live usually on the ground, often near water, but
some kinds in the hottest and dryest places. A few species live near
water, and are accustomed to run about on its surface, without becoming
wet. The <i>Theridiidæ</i> almost all live in the shade, and always upside
down in their webs. Some species live always in caves; and one in the
deepest part of the Mammoth Cave has no eyes. Some spiders live only on
high mountains, never appearing below the tree line. Some species seem
to prefer certain kinds of plants. The horizontal branches of spruces,
for instance, are particularly convenient for the webs of some species
of <i>Theridion</i>. The water-spider, that builds its nest and lives on
water-plants, has been already mentioned, and also the <i>Argyrodes</i>,
that makes its home in the webs of other spiders. During winter immense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
numbers of spiders that have spent the summer under stones, in webs,
and on plants, hide away among fallen leaves, and there live through
the coldest and wettest weather, ready to move on the first warm day.
During a thaw they often come out on the snow in great numbers.</p>

<p>Several house spiders have probably been imported, like rats, and are
found all over the world; while other most common species never spread
beyond the countries where they are most abundant.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>BOOKS ABOUT SPIDERS.</h2></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span>—Thorell’s “Genera
of European Spiders,” in “Acta Regiæ Societatis Scientiarum
Upsalensis,” 1869, and Thorell’s “Synonymes of European Spiders,”
contain a complete history of the classification of the spiders
of Northern Europe, with references to all the descriptions of
genera and species, and remarks on the use of names and groups
by different authors. The great resemblance between the European
and North-American spider faunæ make these the most useful books
for American students. Simon’s “Arachnides de France,” a work not
yet completed, describes all the spiders in France, and refers to
descriptions of the other European species. It contains tables by
which the genus and species to which any spider belongs can be found
by the use of a few prominent characters.</p>

<p> <span class="smcap">Anatomy.</span>—Siebold’s “Anatomy of the
Invertebrata” contains a good general account. Bertkau describes,
in “Traschel’s Archiv für Naturgeschichte,” the mandibles in 1870,
the respiratory-organs in 1872, and the sexual organs in 1875.
Oeffinger describes the spinning-glands in “Archiv für Microscopische
Anatomie,” 1860.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Embryology.</span>—Claparède, Utrecht, 1862,
and Balbiani, in “Annales des Sciences Naturelles,” 1872, describe
the growth of the egg from segmentation to hatching. H. Ludwig, in
“Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche Zoölogie,” 1876, gives an account
of the segmentation in eggs of Philodromus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habits.</span>—Walckenaer’s “Histoire
Naturelle des Apteres” goes over the whole subject. Blackwall, in
“Researches in Zoölogy,” 1834, describes the web-making of Epeira,
and the flying habits of spiders. Blackwall also writes on habits
in “The Spiders of Great Britain and Ireland,” published by the
Ray Society, 1864, and in various papers in “Transactions of the
Linnæan Society,” 1833 to 1841. Menge’s Lebensweise der Arachniden
in “Schriften der Naturforchenden Gesellschaft in Danzig,” 1843,
goes over the whole subject, and is particularly useful on the
sexual habits. The same author continues the subject in “Preussische
Spinnen,” published by the same society, beginning in 1866, and not
yet finished. The habits of the water-spider are described by Mr.
Bell in “Journal of the Linnæan Society,” 1857. The trap-door spiders
and their habits are described by J. T. Moggridge in “Harvesting
Ants and Trap-door Spiders,” published by L. Reeve &amp; Co.,
London, 1873, and Supplement, 1874. Prof. B. G. Wilder has published
several papers on the habits of American spiders, the most useful of
which are the following: on Nephila plumipes from South Carolina,
“Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History,” 1865;
Practical Use of Spider’s Silk in “The Galaxy,” July, 1869; Habits of
Epeira riparia, Moulting of Nephila plumipes, and Nests of Epeira,
Nephila, and Hyptiotes, in “Proceedings of American Association
for Advancement of Science,” 1873; the Triangle Spider in “Popular
Science Monthly,” 1875.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
